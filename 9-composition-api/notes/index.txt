watch and watchEffect

const stopWatch = watch([name, age], ([newName, newAge], [oldName, oldAge]) => {
  console.log(`Name changed from ${oldName} to ${newName}`);
  console.log(`Age changed from ${oldAge} to ${newAge}`);
});

const stopEffect = watchEffect(() => {
  console.log('test')
})

// stop watching
stopWatch()
stopEffect()

watchEffect runs once the component mounts initially but watch don't

*** check how often a method is being called when being used in side a template and something changes in the template
